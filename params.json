{"name":"Jpeg-cmyk","tagline":"JPEG CMYK Support for Java","body":"## JPEG CMYK\r\n\r\nThis project adds support for JPEG CMYK on the Java platform.\r\n\r\nOriginally, it was written by Werner Randelshofer. As he decided to license his work under the Creative Commons By 3.0, I wanted to create a Maven artifact for users of this library, and even enhance it a bit.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAdd the dependency to your project:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>fr.sertelon.media</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>jpeg-cmyk</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.1.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will add support for reading CMYK JPEG with Java ImageIO. However, as there are now two JPEG readers you have to read images like so:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n// Read an image from a File\r\nBufferedImage imgFromFile = CMYKReader.read(File imageFile);\r\n\r\n// Read an image from an ImageInputStream\r\nBufferedImage imgFromImageInputStream = CMYKReader.read(ImageInputStream iis);\r\n\r\n// Read an image from an InputStream\r\nBufferedImage imgFromInputStream = CMYKReader.read(InputStream is);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this library inside a web application project, you should use the provided ContextListener. It will ensure that the library will be loaded by the JDK.\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<web-app>\r\n\t<!-- ... -->\r\n\t<listener>\r\n\t\t<listener-class>fr.sertelon.media.IIOProviderContextListener</listener-class>\r\n\t</listener>\r\n\t<!-- ... -->\r\n</web-app>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nCopyright Werner Randelshofer 2013\r\n\r\nThis software is licenced under the Creative Commons By 3.0, you can find more information in the `LICENSE.md` file.\r\n\r\nThe class fr.sertelon.media.IIOProviderContextListener is licensed under its own terms (see file header) and copyright belongs to Harald Kuhr.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
